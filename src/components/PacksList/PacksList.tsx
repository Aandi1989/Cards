But let's see if we can make it even simpler by wrapping them up into a single useRouter hook that exposes just the data and methods we need. In this recipe we show how easy it is to compose multiple hooks and combine their returned state into a single object. It makes a lot of sense for libraries like React Router to offer a selection of low-level hooks, as using only the hook you need can minimize unnecessary re-renders. That said, sometimes you want a simpler developer experience and custom hooks make that easy.
